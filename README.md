# Hi there, I'm Zhifan (aka c3n21/zhifan)
## About me
- Currently working as a Web Developer && studying Computer Science @UniMi in Italy.
- I love Linux and Open Source (not telling which distro I'm using because that would be a meme), but I don't think that everything else is crap: just different use case.
- NeoVim-mer and I literally use it for everything concerning text editing.
- I practice Calisthenics to alleviate my future carpal tunnel.
- Always tinkering with my little homelab (RPi B3+ & an old laptop)
- Continuous learning.
- I like coffee but I don't abuse it and also I sleep quite early too.
